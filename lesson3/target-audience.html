			<p>Mrs. Veronica is a 39-year-old woman who has 4 children to take care of. Agriculture is the main source of survival for her and her family. She needs better weather conditions to develop her activity. With our short to long-term weather forecasting services, we can help Dona Veronica to better plan the type of crop to grow depending on the type of weather ahead.</p>

			<p>The 54-year-old Mr. Joao and his 18-year-old have been fishermen for a long time and at times they have suffered from climate change while fishing in the deep sea. With our weather services that we offer, we can help Mr. Joao to better plan his fishing activities so that he doesn't have any more surprises while he's at sea.</p>
			
			<h2>Scenarios</h2>

			<h3>Scenarios: 1</h3>

			<p>A group of fishermen wants to go out to sea, but they are very scared due to the cloudy sky. To make the right decision they look to I Weather services to see if the weather can improve in the next two hours. Based on the information provided by I weather, they could have information that this was a passing cloud that would only last twenty minutes, so they waited and then put out to sea.</p>
			
			<h3>Scenarios: 1</h3>
			<p>An agricultural company had planted a considerable amount of sweet potato during this agricultural season. Two and a half months after planting, they had to harvest the sweet potato in an emergency because they had received an alert through I Weather that within the next twenty-four hours there was forecast of torrential rains that could harm some crops. So the company took the possible precautions and collected its products before they were damaged by the waters.</p>
